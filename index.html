    <h1>What is Physics</h1>
    <h2>Physics was formely called natural philosophy, it is concerned with those aspect of natural which can be understood in a fundamental wayin term of elementary principles and laws. In the course of time, various specialized science broke away from Physics to form autonomous fields of investigation. in this process, Physics retained its original aim of understanding the structure of the natural world and explaining natural phenomena</h2>
     <h2><p>The most basic parts of Physics are mechanics and field theory. Mechanics is concerned with the motion of particles or bodies under the action of given forces. The physics of fields is concerned with the orgin nature and properties of gravitation, electromagnetic, nuclear and other force fields. taken together, mechanics and field thoery constitute the most fundamental approach to an understanding o natural phenomena which science offer</h2></p>
    <h2><p>In other words, Physics can be defined or summarise as a physical science that deals with the behaviour of matter in relation to energy. Also it can be said to be science measurement.</p></h2>
    <h1>Reason or benefit for studying physics</h1>
    <h2>1. acquire scientific knowledge and skills.</h2>
    <h2>2. high technology growth</h2>
    <h2>3. Have ability to make our country better</h2>
    <h1>career opportunity in physics</h1>
    <h2>1. Biophysics: this is an interdisciplinary science using methods of, and theories from physics to study biological system</h2>
    <h2>2. Geophysics: this is the study of earth using physics to study the environment of earth in space</h2>
    <h2>3. Agrophysics: this is a branch of science bordering on agronomy and physics whose objects of study are the agro ecosystem</h2>
    <h2>4. Engineering physics: this is the study of the combined disciplines of physics, engineering and mathematics in other to develop an understanding</h2>
    <h2>5. Econo-physics: this is an inter-disciplinary reasearch field, applying theories and methods</h2>
